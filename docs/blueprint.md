# **App Name**: MechQuote

## Core Features:

- Smart Library and BoQ Management: SQL-based hierarchical product tree system, to categorize products with Bill of Quantities; automate price updates by importing supplier Excel lists.
- Dynamic Offer Engine: Module for inputting BoQ by space or system. Auto-adds items to the quote, when an item assembly is selected, for example: 'Fan Coil Installation'.
- CRM and Follow-up Module: Tracking the status of quotations, saving meeting notes and site survey photos in the cloud.
- Currency Update Automation: Automatically fetches exchange rates from the Central Bank and updates costs in 'Draft' quotations.
- Recommendation Tool: Suggests related parts if the user forgets to add them, e.g., if 'Radiator' is added but 'Radiator Valve' is missing, the system will recognize the situation and will suggest an item.
- One-Click Revision: Allows the user to make a discount by clicking one button. Automatically apply a blanket percentage discount (ex: 'Apply a 5% discount from the Grand Total') to all items.
- Profitability Analysis: Before the offer is given, calculate profit: (Material + Labor + General Expenses + Risk Share).
